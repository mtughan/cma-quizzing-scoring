An app for scorekeeping Bible quizzing in the Christian & Missionary Alliance.

This app is coded with the rules specifically from the [Eastern Canadian District](http://www.ecdbiblequizzing.ca/) at this time (last revised 2017), but could be extended to support other districts relatively simply. Feel free to submit a PR with any modifications!
